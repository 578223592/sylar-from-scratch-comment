测试程序在：`tests/test_tcp_server.cc`,通过开关不同的宏即可测试速度。
所有线程使用数量均为1：
测试使用的工具为`ab`，`ab`的使用命令可以在下面结果输出中看到。
## 结果

使用`SERVER_3`宏，即使用：sylar::TcpServer 类，测试结果如下：

`SERVER_1` ，使用原生epoll单线程，测试结果如下：

`SERVER_2` ，使用改造后的协程，而不使用sylar::TcpServer类，测试结果如下：

## 结果分析

直接使用IOM管理协程和使用tcpserver，结果差距有点大，用火焰图分析看看，分析的参数：
ab -n 1000000 -c 1000 http://localhost:12345/
即并发不变，-n增大十倍（运行时间够长，方便分析定位）

这里就不具体看跑出来的结果了，简单说下结果：
Server3
```
Requests per second:    8708.71 [#/sec] (mean)
```
Server2
```
Requests per second:    13606.20 [#/sec] (mean)
```
可以看到在加入perf性能分析之后性能又下降了一些（10％-20％），不过这并不关键，让我们打开火焰图继续分析分析把。
